Going through the LOMA process will allow FEMA and ultimately flood insurance companies to have a better understanding of the flood risk your property faces. If you decide to keep flood insurance, you can expect a significant reduction in your premium. Your mortgage lender may also drop your flood insurance requirement all together.

Depending on the situation, this entire process may take as little as 1 week or as long as 60 days. When you submit your request, No Flood Florida will give you your expected time and keep you updated along the way."

If through our screening process we find that you are almost certainly not going to be able to get a LOMA, we will notify you. But you can rest assured because our service has a money back guarantee!"
